**A Blast from the 80s**

Vice City's world is lovingly recreated, capturing the essence of 1980s Miami. Players can cruise along the beach in a pastel pink convertible, listen to hair metal on the radio, and participate in outrageous missions that wouldn't be out of place in a cheesy action flick. The game's world is divided into distinct districts, each with its own visual style and atmosphere, from the glitzy beachfront to the seedy underbelly.

**Rise of a Criminal Kingpin**

As Tommy Vercetti, players take on a ruthless ex-convict determined to carve out his own piece of the criminal pie in Vice City. Tommy's journey is filled with memorable characters, from the treacherous Ricardo Diaz to the ambitious Sonny Crockett-inspired Lance Vance ([https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lance_Vance](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Lance_Vance)).
