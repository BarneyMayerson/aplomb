# In Space No One Can Hear You Scream: A Review of Alien: Isolation

> "There's something on my tail. And it's moving fast." - Amanda Ripley, Alien: Isolation

Alien: Isolation is a 2014 sci-fi horror game developed by Creative Assembly and published by Sega. The game puts you in the shoes of Amanda Ripley, daughter of Ellen Ripley from the iconic Alien film series. Set fifteen years after the events of the first movie, Amanda finds herself on a decommissioned space station crawling with terror: a Xenomorph.

As Amanda, you'll need to rely on your wits, scavenged resources, and a healthy dose of fear to survive. The AI controlling the Xenomorph is particularly ruthless and unpredictable, constantly stalking you throughout the station. This isn't a game where you can go in guns blazing - stealth, resource management, and a constant sense of dread are what Alien: Isolation is all about.

**Key Takeaways**

-   **Nail-biting Tension:** Alien: Isolation perfectly captures the atmosphere of dread and paranoia from the Alien films. The ever-present threat of the Xenomorph and the creaking, decaying space station will have you on the edge of your seat.
-   **Focus on Stealth:** There's not a lot of ammo in this game, and direct confrontation with the Xenomorph is a recipe for disaster. You'll need to use your environment, crafting system, and cunning to outsmart the alien and avoid detection.
-   **A Faithful Recreation:** The developers lovingly recreated the world of Alien. From the iconic sound design to the claustrophobic interiors of the Nostromo, fans of the franchise will feel right at home.
-   **Not for the Faint of Heart:** Alien: Isolation is a genuinely scary game. The constant threat of the Xenomorph and the bleak atmosphere make it a difficult but rewarding experience.

**Is Alien: Isolation Right for You?**

If you're a fan of the Alien franchise and love suspenseful horror games, then Alien: Isolation is a must-play. Just be prepared to have your heart rate elevated for the entire playthrough!

For those who prefer action-packed games or dislike jump scares, this might not be the best fit. Alien: Isolation is a slow burn that relies on building tension and atmosphere.

This game is available on a variety of platforms including PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and even Mobile Alien: Isolation on Steam: [https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/214490/Alien_Isolation/).
